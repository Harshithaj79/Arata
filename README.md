# Arata
ARATA is a queue-based cafeteria food ordering system designed for university campuses. It enables students to browse food items, select cafeterias, receive estimated waiting times using data structures, and place orders online. The system is built with Flask, Python, HTML, and CSS, and is deployed on PythonAnywhere.
